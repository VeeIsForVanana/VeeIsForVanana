<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Victor!</h1>
<h3 align="center">A smart, energetic systems builder 🛠️ from the Philippines 🇵🇭</h3>
<p> I honestly don't know how else to describe myself. I'm at the stage of my life where I'm scared to commit to any one thing, but I have potential for just about everything. So let's just say I like building systems. </p>

<p> Anyway, I'm <strong>Victor Edwin Reyes</strong>, but you can call me Victor! I'm a student taking up a <strong>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science</strong> at the <strong>University of the Philippines - Diliman</strong>. Aside from that, I've had a wide range of experiences in many academic fields. I've also taken on a number of leadership and training roles in various organizations and projects. Including: </p>

<ul>
<li> Intern for UPRI </li>
<li> Backend Developer for GINA </li>
<li> Developer for DRAP </li>
<li> Technical Head for DeliVault </li>
<li> And most recently, Director for Engineering of UP CSI </li>
</ul>
