<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Victor!</h1>
<h3 align="center">A smart, energetic computer scientist üõ†Ô∏è from the Philippines üáµüá≠</h3>

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<p> I'm <strong>Victor Edwin Reyes</strong>, but you can call me Victor! I'm a student taking up a <strong>Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science</strong> at the <strong>University of the Philippines - Diliman</strong>. Aside from that, I've had a wide range of experiences in many academic fields. I've also taken on a number of leadership and training roles in various organizations and projects. Including: </p>

<!-- Link all of these -->
<ul>
<li> Intern for UPRI </li>
<li> Backend Developer for GINA </li>
<li> Developer for DRAP </li>
<li> Technical Head for DeliVault </li>
<li> And most recently, Director for Engineering of UP CSI </li>
</ul>

<!-- Why just Computer Scientist? -->
<p> Out of the many roles I could call myself, I think I'm currently happiest calling myself a <strong>computer scientist</strong>. It's a nebulous and broad term, because my interests are about as nebulous and broad. I have experience in full-stack web development, data science, game development, and low-level systems development, and I'm interested in exploring further in all those fields. </p>

<p> If I were asked to pick for now though, my best fit is as a <strong>full-stack web developer</strong> since that's where my strongest experience is. Like I said above, though, I don't think my strengths just lie here. </p>

<p> Really, at the end of the day, I think my skillset is easily applicable to other fields with just some prep time. Computer science as a field equips me, and others like me, with the tools to design solutions that are versatile across diverse platforms and implementations. </p>

<!-- What I do in my spare time -->
<p> Whenever I have spare time, I work on some of my other hobbies - reading and writing stories, playing video games, working on a coding project, or learning some new skills involving some of the prior three. </p>
